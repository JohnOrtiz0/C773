  <p>Pets are nature's gift to humanity. It has been scientifically proven that opening our homes and hearts
     to a pet increases our longevity and improves our overall quality of life as well as the lives of our
      pets. At Pet Paradigm Professionals, our mission is to offer resources to help you care for your furry,
       scaly, feathery, and slimy loved ones. Our pet experts—or “Pexperts”—have been working with pet owners
        and professionals alike for the past twelve years. They offer one-on-one consultations with current
         and prospective pet owners as well as group presentations designed for veterinary, pet shelter, and
          pet breeding professionals.</p>
